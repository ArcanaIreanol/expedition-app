<div id="encounter">
  <p>
    <strong>Encounters</strong> are the various black cards that represent key story
    characters, or enemies lying in wait.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Health</strong>: the enemy's starting health.
    <li><strong>Strengths/Weaknesses</strong>: against types of attacks or situations.
    <li><strong>Surge</strong>: their special attack, which happens randomly during combat.
    <li><strong>Tier</strong>: indicates difficulty.
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="quest">
  <p>
    <strong>Adventurers</strong> represent you and your party. Every adventurer has their own
    strengths - it's up to you to realize them.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li> <strong>Health</strong>: the amount of health you start with is next to the heart. Use a paper clip to keep track of your current health by sliding it along the edge.
    <li> <strong>Abilities</strong>: The number and type of your starting combat abilities.
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="guided">
  <p>
    <strong>Your Guide controls the world</strong>, and you affect the world through them.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Guide sets up the story, environment, and challenges for you to overcome.
    <li>Ask them questions about your quest and your surroundings if you're unclear on what to do next.
    <li>You may control your character's actions, but your Guide controls the world's reaction. Exercise caution.
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="stasis">
  <p>
    Expedition is a game with <strong>open rules:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can make your character do whatever you want. Just tell your Guide, and it'll happen.
    <li>Use the environment to your advantage - if you find a cloth tent,
    try setting it on fire or ripping through it.
    <li>Creativity applies to combat, too! Your action doesn't have to be an Ability card every round.
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="combatend">
  <p>
    At the end of some battles, you get <strong>Loot</strong>.
    Loot can be used at any time - inside or outside of combat - to heal, damage enemies, or advance the plot.
    Using Loot is instantaneous and does not prevent you from using an ability during combat.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Tier</strong>: the relative power of the loot.
    <li><strong>Usage</strong>: how often it can be used.
    <li><strong>Effects</strong>: choose from one of these when you use the Loot.
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="questsetup">
  <p>
    <strong>Abilities</strong> are actions you make during combat.
    They can be offensive or defensive, target yourself or others, and may or may not fail catastrophically when used.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Risk</strong>: you need to roll at least as high as this number to succeed.
    <li><strong>Target(s)</strong>: how many enemies or allies you may target.
    <li><strong>Effects</strong>: what happens when different dice values are rolled.
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="prepforcombat">
  <p>
    Every Encounter is a series of Rounds. Combat continues until one side prevails.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every round, you'll play one Ability. (Note: Some Abilities may allow you to play additional cards)
    <li>Choose your abilities quickly - damage increases the longer you deliberate.
    <li>There are no take-backsies. Once you've played a card, that decision is final.
    <li>At the end of each round of combat, re-shuffle all of your Ability cards back into your deck, including the Ability you played this round.
  </ul>
</div>
