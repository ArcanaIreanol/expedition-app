      <p>
        <strong>Encounters</strong> are the various black cards that represent key story 
        characters, or enemies lying in wait.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Health</strong>: the enemy's starting health.
        <li><strong>Strengths/Weaknesses</strong>: against types of attacks or situations.
        <li><strong>Surge</strong>: a special attack or action that sometimes happens.
        <li><strong>Tier</strong>: indicates difficulty.
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="quest">
      <p>
        <strong>Adventurers</strong> represent you and your party. Every adventurer has their own 
        role and special skills - it's up to you to realize them.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <strong>Health</strong>: the amount of health you start with is next to the heart. Use a paper clip to keep track of your current health by sliding it along the edge.
        <li> <strong>Bonuses</strong>: you get a bonus to any roleplaying rolls that you can make fit these categories.
        <li> <strong>Abilities</strong>: The number and type of your starting combat abilities.
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="guided">
      <p>
        <strong>Your Guide controls the world</strong>, and you affect the world through them. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Guide sets up the story, environment, and challenges for you to overcome.
        <li>Ask them questions about your quest and your surroundings if you're unclear on what to do next.
        <li>You may control your character's actions, but your Guide controls the world's reaction. Exercise caution.
      </ul>

    <div id="stasis">
      <p>
        Expedition is a game with <strong>open rules:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can make your character do whatever you want. Just tell your Guide, and it'll happen.
        <li>Use the environment to your advantage - if you find a cloth tent, 
        try setting it on fire or ripping through it.
        <li>Creativity applies to combat, too! Your action doesn't have to be an Ability card every round.
        <li>Try crafting your roleplaying action to fit one of the Skills on your Explorer card to captialize on your roll bonuses.
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="combatend">
      <p>
        At the end of some battles, you get <strong>Loot</strong>: tools, weapons, and other tangible items. 
        They can be used at any time to heal, damage enemies, or advance the plot.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Tier</strong>: the relative power of the loot.
        <li><strong>Usage</strong>: how often it can be used.
        <li><strong>Effects</strong>: choose from one of these when you use the Loot.
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="questsetup">
      <p>
        <strong>Abilities</strong> are actions you make during combat. 
        They can be offensive or defensive, target yourself or others, and may or may not fail catastrophically when used.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Risk</strong>: you need to roll at least as high as this number to succeed.
        <li><strong>Target(s)</strong>: how many enemies or allies are affected.
        <li><strong>Damage or Health</strong>: how much you hurt or heal your target.
        <li><strong>Effects</strong>: what happens on success or failure.
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="prepforcombat">
      <p>
        Every Encounter is a series of Rounds. Combat continues until one side prevails.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every round, you'll play one or more Ability cards to attack the enemy.
        <li>Choose your abilities quickly - damage increases the longer you deliberate.
        <li>There are no take-backsies. Once you've played a card, that decision is final.
