  <roleplay title="Spring Cleaning" data-line="10">
    <p>The sun shines through your curtains. As you groggily stir awake, you remember what day it is - the day of the village's annual spring cleaning!</p>
    <p>You shake awake, leap out of bed, and do some quick stretches to get your blood flowing. You grab your weapon from the side of your bed. You're ready to clean!</p>
  </roleplay>
  <roleplay title="The Ceremony" data-line="16">
    <p>You jog towards the opening ceremony. You know you should save your energy for the long day of cleaning ahead, but you're just too excited.</p>
    <p>The village's Lord gives his traditional speech - <i>blah blah, a clean dungeon is a healthy village, blah blah</i>. You're surrounded by other teams of warriors, fighters and adventurers, each double checking their gear and fidgeting with excitement.</p>
    <p>With a loud <b>"BEGIN!"</b>, the mob of people rushes into the nearby cave entrance.</p>

  <roleplay title="Level 1" data-line="24">
    <p>You charge into the dungeon, weapon drawn.</p>
    <p>As you run down the narrow stone tunnel, you look to down a corridor to your right - and see a wizard freezing a skeleton. To your left, a warrior beheading a zombie. You begin to worry that all the good fights are claimed.</p>
    <p>Distracted, you run right into...</p>

    <p>You charge forward, encouraged by the number of contestants still fighting their first monster.</p>

        <p>Your heart pumping with adrenaline, you quickly loot the bodies. Not making the mistake you made last year, you turn around and follow the stairs down to the next level.</p>

    <p>It's quieter down here. Many of the faces of fun and celebration you saw on the first level are now replaced by grimaces of pain and determination. But the prize for winning the Spring Cleaning is worth battling through the pain.</p>

    <p>The deeper you go, the stronger the monsters get - but the more tired you get. You contemplate taking a break... but as you start to sit down, another team runs past you and begins fighting a pack of cave wolves.</p>
    <p>...or were they actually running from what's right behind you?</p>

        <p>You let loose a yell, full of pain, tiredness and thrill. You've completed the Spring Cleaning!</p>
        <p>Panting, you look around - there's only one other team down here so far, and they're still battling their monster. You make eye contact with them. They nod in defeat, acknowledging your victory.</p>

        <p>Making your way back up the dungeon and back to the ceremony, the Lord invites you to the stage, raising your arm in his and shouting out to the crowd, "Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you... this year's SPRING CLEAN WINNERS!"</p>
        <p>Mages behind the stage let loose fireballs into the sky, and the Lady comes out with a small chest. Facing you, she opens it to reveal this year's prize... a stunning, powerful and magically-enchanted Diffracting Gem. As the fireballs explode overhead, their brilliance is reflected a thousand times in the large diamond.</p>
        <instruction>
          <p>Draw the tier 3 loot "Diffracting Gem"- you may use this on your next quest.</p>
