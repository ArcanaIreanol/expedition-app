  <p>You are in front of a witch's hut. You've come here to find a cure for the illness that has suddenly sprung upon your town. It has already infected many of your closest friends, and you hope to stop it before it is too late.</p>
  <p>Nobody in the town trusts the witch - and many blame her for the illness - but no doctor in town has been able to help. She is your last hope.</p>
  <p>You knock on her door. She open it catiously, and asks why you've come.</p>
