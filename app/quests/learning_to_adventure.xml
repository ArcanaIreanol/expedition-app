  <roleplay title="Your adventure begins">
    <p>"So, you want to go on an adventure?" the grizzly town guardsman asks with a smile.</p>
    <p>You, the trouble-making children of the town, nod eagerly.</p>
    <p>"Alrighty, then! Just don't tell your parents it was me!"</p>

      <p>This is an instruction. You'll see them throughout quests, providing helpful tips and instructions for you to follow.</p>

    <p>"Well, then - you've got a decision to make! Would you rather deal with some of the rowdy fairy folk, or help clean up the guardhouse?"</p>
    <instruction>
      <p>At this point, your party should decide which option you'd like to pick. Your choices will affect your adventure, so choose wisely!</p>

      <roleplay title="A Fairly Big Problem">
        <p>"Alrighty - knew that one would excite you. Here's the deal: an imp and a mushroom are causing a commotion at the market. As honorary members of the town watch, you may use whatever force is necessary to bring peace to the town!"</p>
      </roleplay>
      <roleplay title="The Market">
        <p>{{intimidated = 0}} {{arrested = 0}}</p>
        <p>You make your way to the market. The guardsman wasn't kidding about a commotion - you see a tiny imp and a floating magical mushroom flying around, upsetting stalls and running into people.</p>
      </roleplay>
      <roleplay title="The Market" id="market">
        <p>The situation is bad. Bread lies broken on the ground. Merchants are mad. Tea leaves trodden upon. Squashes squashed!</p>
        <p>You consider your options:</p>

          <roleplay title="Intimidation Tactics">
            <p>{{intimidated = 1}}</p>
            <p>You march up to them, waving your wooden swords.</p>
            <p>"As honorary members of the town watch, we demand you stop disturbing the peace!"</p>
            <p>The imp, seeing your small stature, lets loose an impish laugh and continues mischief-making.</p>

            <p>{{arrested = -1}} {{intimidated = -1}}</p>
            <p>You pursue them, but they're too fast to handcuff.</p>
            <p>The citizens begin to yell at you for making the commotion even worse.</p>

        <p>He hands you the broom, and runs off. He sure seems scared of spiders for being such a big, tough guardsman.</p>
