Spec:
  <choice win lose goto="element_id">
    Text or other HTML to indicate player action.
    win/loose boolean attributes auto-exec this branch when players win/lose the containing
    <encounter> node.

    One or more of the following ONLY (consumed linearly, then moves to next block):
    <roleplay></roleplay>
    OR
    <encounter></encounter>
    OR 
    <end></end>

    The goto attribute is only valid if the choice has no inner content. When clicked,
    the choice will jump to the quest element with that ID. Destination elements must
    be one of <roleplay>, <encounter>, or <end>.
  </choice>

  <roleplay icon="" title="" id="">
    Text or other HTML to inform player decision and/or tell the story.  
    If there's only text, each text segment is wrapped in a paragraph tag
    and extra whitespace is ignored. 

    Icon is optional and sets the background icon of the card.

    The id attribute is also optional and allows use of <choice goto>.

    Zero or more of:
    <a></a>
    (If zero, a "next" button is shown that moves to the following block. 
     A "back" icon is always shown on the top of the page.)
  </roleplay>

  <encounter icon="" id="">
    Note: encounter cards are skipped over when using the "back" button.

    One or more of:
    <e>Encounter Name</e>

    The encounter name must match one of the existing enemy cards in order to
    properly resolve the tier of the card.

    The id attribute is also optional and allows use of <choice goto>.

    MUST have both:
    <choice win></choice>
    <choice lose></choice>

    Must NOT have unattributed choice elements, i.e:
    <choice></choice>
  </encounter>

  <end title="" icon="" id="">
    Behaves the same as a roleplay card, but only one button of "Return to Menu".

    The id attribute is also optional and allows use of <choice goto>.

    Must NOT have <choice> or <encounter> or <roleplay> children.
  </end>
